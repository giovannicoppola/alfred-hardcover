<h1 id="motivation">Motivation ‚úÖ</h1>
Being able to quickly:
- add a book to my library
- check my library for the status, rating, and shelves of a book, and change them
- find a book, or shelf, and open it on Hardcover
- list my books by status, shelf, or rating.

<h1 id="setting-up">Setting up ‚öôÔ∏è</h1>

- get your API key [here](https://hardcover.app/account/api), and paste it into the `Hardcover API token` field in `Workflow Configuration`

## Options
- set the number of results when querying the Hardcover database (slightly slower if many). Default: 19.
- set the interval at which `alfred-hardcover` checks for changes on the main Hardcover site (default: 7). Database is automatically refreshed after any changes are made by `alfred-hardcover`.

<h1 id="usage">Basic Usage üìñ</h1>
The fundamental unit of the Workflow is a book result. Once you get to a list of books you can perform one of these operations:

1. add or remove from shelves (`^ (ctrl)`)
2. change reading status (`‚åò (cmd)`)
3. open on Hardcover (`‚Ü©Ô∏è (enter)`)
4. assign or change rating (`‚å• (option)`)
5. delete from library (`‚åò-^ (cmd-ctrl)`)
6. Quick Look (`‚áß shift`) will load the corresponding Hardcover page.  

How to get to a list of books? Five main ways:
1. by listing the books in your library (set hotkey or use a keyword (default: `!hc`))
2. by listing your books grouped by shelf (default keyword: `!hs`)
3. by listing your books grouped by reading status (default keyword: `!ht`)
4. by listing your books grouped by rating (default keyword: `!hr`)
5. by searching the Hardcover catalog (this search is similar to `‚åò-k` on the Hardcover website. Set hotkey, or default keyword: `!hd`) 

In the library and database search you can use sort flags to sort your results:
- `--y`: by year (newest first)
- `--r`: by rating (highest first)
- `--t`: by title (alphabetical)

A couple of other things:
- In most visualizations, `‚åò-‚å•`(command-option) will move back to the previous visualization
- `::hardcover-refresh` will force database refresh 

That's it! Let me know if anything does not work, or if you'd like to add features. 


<h1 id="known-issues">Limitations & known issues ‚ö†Ô∏è</h1>
None known for now, but if you see anything, let me know. 

<h1 id="changelog">Changelog üß∞</h1>
- 2025-02-17 First release (v0.1)

<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è</h1>
I don't think I will use any of these below, but if others are interested these are some of the possible next steps:

1. set reading progress
2. being able to search by shelf membership (e.g. `Lincoln` in `Biographies`)
